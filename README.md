 Overview
This project is an interactive C++ demonstration of different linked list implementations, covering:
1. Singly Linked List (Modern C++ with `std::unique_ptr`)  
2. Doubly Linked List (Manual memory management)  
3. Circular Linked List (Manual memory management)  
4. STL `forward_list` (Singly linked)  
5. STL `list` (Doubly linked)  

It serves as both a learning tool for data structures and a reference implementation for best practices in C++ memory management.

Features
✅ Interactive CLI Menu – Test all operations (insert, delete, reverse, sort, etc.)  
✅ Modern C++ Techniques – Safe memory handling with `unique_ptr`  
✅ STL Comparison – See how raw implementations compare to `std::forward_list` and `std::list`  
✅ Error Handling – Robust input validation and exception safety  
✅ Educational – Clear code structure with comments for learners  


 How to Use
